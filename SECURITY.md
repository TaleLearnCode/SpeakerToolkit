# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Speaker Toolkit, we kindly ask that you help us protect users by following a responsible disclosure process:

- **Please do not open a public issue.**
- Instead, report the issue privately by emailing:

```
security@speakertoolkit.dev
```

Include as much detail as possible in your report, such as steps to reproduce the issue, environment context, and any known impacts.

## Our Commitment

We take security seriously. Here's what you can expect from us:

- We will acknowledge your report within **three business days**.
- We will promptly investigate and validate the issue.
- We will provide an estimated timeline for resolution and may ask clarifying questions along the way.
- Once resolved, weâ€™ll share a summary of the fix (when appropriate) and acknowledge your contribution if desired.

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security support for the latest **published release** of the Speaker Toolkit. Older versions may not receive patches or backported fixes.
