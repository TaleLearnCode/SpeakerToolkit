# Support Guidelines

Thank you for using the Speaker Toolkit! We’re committed to helping you get the most out of the platform, whether you're deploying infrastructure, writing talks, or submitting to your next shindig.

This document outlines how to find help, report issues, and connect with the community.

## 🙋‍♂️ Getting Help

Before opening a support request, we recommend:

- **Check the Documentation:**   The `/docs` directory contains architecture overviews, assumptions, risk registers, and detailed workflow breakdowns.
- **Search Existing Issues:**   Browse the GitHub Issues to see if your question has already been addressed.
- **Review Release Notes:**   Visit the Releases page for known bugs, new features, and upgrade guidance.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs or Issues

If you’ve encountered a bug or something isn’t working as expected:

1. Check for an existing issue first.
2. If none exists, open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
3. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details (CLI version, OS, platform, etc.).

Well-described issues help us diagnose and resolve problems more quickly. Screenshots, logs, or error messages are always helpful!

## 💡 Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea to make Speaker Toolkit even better? We’d love to hear it!

- Open a Feature Request and describe:
  - The use case or problem
  - Any existing workarounds
  - How would your idea help you (or others)

We regularly triage feature ideas, and community input heavily influences what we work on next.

## 🔒 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, follow our Security Policy for private and responsible disclosure.

## 📢 Community Support

We’re building a welcoming and collaborative space! Join the discussion and connect with other contributors:

- GitHub Discussions (coming soon)
- [Your community Slack, Discord, or mailing list if applicable]
- Conference demos and project walkthroughs

## 📆 Response Times

We aim to respond to issues and requests within **3–5 business days**. Open source is a team effort—thanks for your patience and collaboration.
